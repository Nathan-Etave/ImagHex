# ImagHex

ImagHex is a simple tool for encoding files into graphical representations of their bytes and vice versa.  
The graphical representation is a PNG image where each pixel represents 4 bytes of the file.

## Features

- Encode files into PNG images
- Decode PNG images back into files
- Support all input file types (the output is always a PNG image) and sizes (limited by available memory)

## Usage

Encode a file :
```shell
imaghex encode <input_file> <output_dir>
```

Decode a file :
```shell
imaghex decode <input_file.png> <output_dir>
```

## Example

Input file `secret.mp4` :  
ðŸŽµðŸ•º

Encoded image `secret.png` :
